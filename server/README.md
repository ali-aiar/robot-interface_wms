# Robot Interface and Warehouse Management System (WMS) Project
## Description
Welcome to the Robot Interface and Warehouse Management System (WMS) Project!

This project aims to provide a server-side solution for automating warehouse management tasks using robots. The server is implemented in Python and is responsible for handling communication between the robots and the warehouse management system.

The server is responsible for receiving requests from the robots, processing the requests, and returning appropriate responses. It also interfaces with the warehouse management system to retrieve and update information about the warehouse inventory and layout.

Some of the key features of the server include:

- Communication with robots using a custom protocol over a network connection
- Processing of requests from robots, including tasks such as retrieving and updating inventory information and directing robots to specific locations in the warehouse
- Integration with the warehouse management system to retrieve and update information about the warehouse inventory and layout
- Fault tolerance and error handling to ensure reliable operation of the system

We hope this server helps to improve the efficiency and accuracy of warehouse management tasks and contributes to the overall success of your business.

## Features
- Communication with robots using a custom protocol over a network connection
- Processing of requests from robots, including tasks such as retrieving and updating inventory information and directing robots to specific locations in the warehouse
- Integration with the warehouse management system to retrieve and update information about the warehouse inventory and layout
- Fault tolerance and error handling to ensure reliable operation of the system
- User-friendly web interface for managing and monitoring the warehouse and robots
- Customizable rules and settings for controlling the behavior of the robots and warehouse management system
- Automatic generation of reports and analytics on warehouse performance and efficiency.
## Installation
Create a python virtual environment, install a package and use it in a module.
```console
python -m venv venv
```
Run the command below to use it:
```console
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
In windows, if the above command doesn't work, it means the execution policy must be set to unrestricted.
```console
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
Install the dependencies:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

To use the Robot Interface and Warehouse Management System (WMS), you will need to connect your robots to the server and configure them according to the instructions in the documentation.

Once the robots are connected and configured, you can use the web interface to manage and monitor the warehouse and robots. Some of the tasks you can perform include:

- Viewing the current inventory and layout of the warehouse
- Directing robots to specific locations in the warehouse
- Updating the inventory and layout information
- Setting rules and parameters for controlling the behavior of the robots and warehouse management system
- Generating reports and analytics on warehouse performance and efficiency

You can also use the API to programmatically interact with the server and perform these tasks. See the documentation for more information on using the API.

Note: Make sure you have the correct permissions and access levels to perform these tasks.
